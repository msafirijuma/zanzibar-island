                <span><i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i> Mizingani Road, Zanzibar City</span>
                <p>The Old Fort (Swahili: Ngome Kongwe), also known as the Arab Fort, is among the oldest building located in Stone Town, the capital of Zanzibar. It is the oldest building and a major visitor attraction of Stone Town. It is located on the main seafront, adjacent to another landmark building of the city, the House of Wonders
                (former palace of the Sultan of Zanzibar), and facing the Forodhani Gardens.</p>
                <p>It was built by Omani Arabs after expelling the Portuguese in 1699. It was used as a garrison and prison in the 19th century, and as a terminal of the Zanzibar railways 1905-28. A new guardhouse was built in 1947 and used as the ladies' club, and an amphitheatre was added in the 1990s. It is now the headquarters of the Zanzibar international film
                festival.</p>
                <p>The Old Fort is one of the prominent visitor attractions in Stone Town, and its courtyard has been adapted to serve as a cultural centre with curio shops selling tourist-oriented merchandise such as tingatinga paintings; it also has an
                open-air amphitheatre where live dance and music shows are held most evenings, a restaurant, and a tourist information
                desk. It is also the main venue used for large events such as the Festival of the Dhow Countries (also known as the
                Zanzibar International Film Festival) and the Sauti za Busara.</p>

The settlement ruins bear this nickname.</p>

                <p>Ras Mkumbuu is a peninsula located in Pemba South, Tanzania. The estimate terrain elevation above seal level is -9999 metres. Variant forms of spelling for Ras Mkumbuu or in other languages: Ndagoni Peninsula, Mkumbuu Peninsula, Ras Mkumbuu, Mkumbuu Peninsula, Ndagoni Peninsula, Ras Mkumbuu. These rains lie close to the village of Ndagoni at the end of a long narrow peninsula known as Ras Mkumbuu, which lies to the
                northwest of the town of Chake-Chake.</p>
                <p>The ruins mainly date from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, though there are indications that they were built over older foundations. Notable among these ruins are those of a large mosque which was for some time the largest structure of its type in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                <p>The site is covered by ruins of supposed 11<sup>th</sup> century mosque, several graves, and the old chief's house. There are many ruins near the site but most of them are widely covered by trees and grasses due to abandonment.</p>
